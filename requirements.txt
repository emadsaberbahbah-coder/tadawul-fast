# requirements.txt — Tadawul Fast Bridge (FastAPI) (v2.0.0)
# Target runtime: Python 3.11.9
#
# ✅ Enhanced vs your file:
# - Removes risky hard-pins of transitive deps (Starlette/httpcore/uvloop/etc.)
#   that commonly break builds or Windows dev installs.
# - Keeps pins ONLY on your direct dependencies (repeatable + safer).
# - Still stable on Render (Linux) and much safer locally (Windows).
